# Domain Driven Development (DDD) ðŸ§Š

Domain Driven Development (DDD) or Design focuses on good maintainability, readability, and testability of code. 

I want to show you a clear example of what DDD looks like and how it was applied in a project I worked on before.

## Todo

1. Test the code works correctly.
2. Apply notes and tweaks from my original example.
